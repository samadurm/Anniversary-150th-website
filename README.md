People Who Contributed:

Goal:

For this assignment, our goal was to create a website that could celebrate the 150th anniversary of OSU.
We wanted to capture something where everyone could bring their own personality and put it into a canvas.
Thus, we came up with the idea to create a website where you could draw what you wanted and posted it on the website.
There are four different tabs that include the "Home-Tab", "All-Posts-Tab", "Add-Post-Tab", and lastly, the "Browse-Tab".
There is also a "Search-Bar" that you may use.

What they each contain:

"Home-Tab": This is the default tab for when you load the website. This tab shows a brief description of where/what OSU is, a
couple of interesting facts, and lastly a slideshow of photos that Matthew took of different parts of campus.

"All-Posts-Tab": This tab contains all the posts on the server. At any time you may like a post by pressing the like or dislike button, or if you are
intrigued, you can press on the image can comment or like.

"Add-Post-Tab": This tab contains the elements to create a new post. There is a canvas that you can draw on and just to the right of the canvas there is a little tool section and a
little section to add a title and write who the author is. When you have completed both the required information, you can press post and it takes you to the page that includes all the posts.

"Browse-Tab": This tab is a sort-of show-off tab. It contains three of the top liked posts, three of the top disliked posts, and three random posts. As with any of the other pages, you can
press on the image and it takes you to the comment page.

"Search-Bar": For the search bar you can search any of the posts by title or author. If there are no similar posts, then the page displays a "No Posts Were found.".

In conclusion, we hope that you enjoy the website and help celebrate the 150 year anniversary of OSU. Go to the "Add-Posts-Tab", get your mouse ready, put your beret on, and get ready to draw!
